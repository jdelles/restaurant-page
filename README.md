## Introduction
This is the third project in the JavaScript track at The Odin Project. The course just provided tutorials on using webpack and this project is intended to practice with and demonstrate this skill. 

## Skill
- Webpack
- NPM
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML

## Tools
- VSCode
- Git / GitHub

## Resources
- [Webpack tutorial and configuration](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/#using-a-configuration)


## To do 
- [X] Create github repo and link to project folder
- [X] Install npm, webpack-cli
- [X] Create src and dist folders
- [X] Create src/index.js, dist/index.html, webpack.config.js and initialize them per the tutorial
- [X] Build HTML skeleton of home page
- [X] Test webpack is compiling index.js 
- [ ] Build home page exclusively with JS
- [ ] Build modules for menu and contact page 
- [ ] Build nav logic that toggles through the page modules
- [ ] Publish to GitHub - will require additional config since it's looking for index.html but webpack is setup to use dist/index.html
